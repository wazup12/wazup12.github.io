# What is a Buffer Overflow
A buffer overflow attack is one that exploits the location of a variable in memory.
> DESCRIPTION\
>       Never use this function.\
>       gets()  reads  a  line from stdin into the buffer pointed to by s until either a terminating newline or EOF, which it replaces with a null byte ('\0').  No check for buffer overrun is performed (see BUGS below).\
